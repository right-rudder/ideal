            I acquired Ideal Aviation in 2011 and since then I've earned my private, instrument, and multi-engine ratings.  It's been a fantastic opportunity to combine work and pleasure.  I enjoy flying for business and personal trips.

            Our family has a long history in aviation.  My father and mother were both aviators.  In the 1930s, we owned the Von Hoffman Aircraft Corporation and the Von Hoffman Flying School.

      Ideal Aviation expanded its operation and spans over three hangars in St. Louis Downtown Airport.  Today, we have over 13 flight instructors and 13 different aircraft and we're continually growing.  Ideal Aviation is a full-service aircraft rental, flight training, and fractional aircraft ownership that has been serving both present and future pilots.  We wouldn't be able to get this far without the hard work and commitment from our team.
